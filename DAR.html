          <h3>Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation</h3>
          <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Data Visualization &rsquo; refers to the visual representation of statistical and other types of numeric and non-numeric data through the use of static or interactive pictures and graphics.&rdquo;</span></i></p>
          <p>-</span>(Gatto, n.d.)</span></p>
          <p>Data Visualizations is often used for scientific purposes as these are seen as tools in data exploration and formulating hypotheses, however, there have been investigations into how artist take scientific methods and apply them to their creation of art and their pursuit of representation (Vi&eacute;gas and Wattenberg, 2007). Vi&eacute;gas and Wattenberg provide us with a definition of &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; visualisation.</span></p>
          <p>&ldquo;First, the artworks must be based on actual data, rather than the metaphors or surface appearance of visualization. Many artists have used diagrammatic imagery as a base for their projects. &hellip; A second point is that our definition avoids the issue of beauty: we do not contend that beautiful scientific visualizations are automatically artistic, or that visualization art must be pretty. Thus, a microscope photograph taken as part of a scientific experiment would not qualify under our definition: no matter how beautiful the colours, the photograph would lack artistic intent.&rdquo;</span></i></p>
          <p>-(Vi&eacute;gas and Wattenberg, 2007)</span></p>
          <p>With the invention of computers, data visualization has come a long way in terms of aesthetics and has developed what is known as traditional data visualization, having different forms and characteristics. These allow for the understanding of data, efficiency and effectiveness to be emphasized (Li, 2020).</span></p>
          <p>Data visualisation and the combination of artist forms data-driven artwork and creates representation. Data-driven artwork refers to the aesthetic creation that comes from displaying data. This is where companies and things providing the data serve us rather than the other way around, converting data to a more easily consumable form that is relatable(Simpson, 2020). Communicating results and processes has been a part of communication for many years, being one of the oldest forms of communication. Drawings, visuals, and gestures are extremely effective in conveying information. Known as the demonstrational paradigm, it extends itself to &ldquo;&hellip;visual construction and visual data exploration&rdquo; (Saket and Endert, 2019).</span></p>
          <p>With the mention of representation, there have been many different debates on what the concept is. Jenny Kidd introduces the theories of representation: </span>&ldquo;Representation and reality; representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation and identity politics&rdquo; </span>(Kidd, 2015)</span></p>
          <p>Representation is focused on meaning creation, and then there is an investigation on the many examples that introduce complexities. This introduces a topic of semiotics/semiology from Stuart Halls's constructivist concept of representation. Semiotics is reliant on words and language (Kidd, 2015). Representation can be understood as what is seen vs what is understood, connotation vs denotation (Barthes, 1957). An example that is provided by Kidd is the Apple logo, which is an apple with a bite taken out of it, it is understood as the company Apple&rsquo;s logo. Visual analysis is something that allows for a more open investigation of meaning. Kidd quotes Gripsrud, &lsquo;images are composed of elements that are not as clearly distinguished as the word signs of verbal language. The meanings of images are therefore often unclear, fleeting or plural&rsquo; (Gripsrud 2006: 32). When examining visual media, you have to understand context, and purpose, whether it is denotative or connotative. An example that I can personally provide is the concept of &lsquo;photoshop&rsquo; (the act of manipulating an image) existing since the 1940s, during WWII, images would be staged and therefore the context of the time is important to understand to be able to evaluate the images(Fineman, 2012).</span></p>
          <p>&ldquo;Data visualizations are now a core staple of news media provision, in papers, periodicals, on television, and especially on the web where they become animated and interactive. Such forms bring together images, symbols, tabular and graphical content and text in order to tell stories that have their origins in data.&rdquo;</span></i></p>
          <p>(Kidd, 2015, p. 30).</span></p>
          <p>Data visualisation is not solely about aesthetics but also about making knowledge consumable in a different way within &lsquo;knowledge generation&rsquo;. Kidd makes the statement that we do not know what the repercussions are of computational representation (Kidd, 2015).</span></p>
          <p>In the writing by Sabine Roeser, they examine the idea of how art allows for there to be a conversation about ethics on risky technologies. Techno-art is &ldquo;art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies.&rdquo; (Roeser, 2016). Engaging in art through technology provides new opportunities for creation and topics to investigate. Techno-art delivers a very clear and strong message that allows those who consume it to relate to it as it is a vivid representation. Techno-artists are able to shine a light on necessary topics and societal issues., as well as a critical reflection of technologies and scientific advancements(Roeser, 2016). With this idea of techno-art in mind, one can see how art using scientific methods to provide representation is essential and plausible.</span></p>
          <p>As much as technology and art can give us important things like giving a voice to societal issues as well as providing representation for marginalized groups there are faults. Techno-art might not be able to evoke the emotions that artworks can or even focus on unimportant things that are unlikely to happen. For example, in data art, 3D is considered a very bad way of providing information, as it distorts reality and makes understanding the data difficult just for the sake of art, and almost portrays unnecessary things (Healy, n.d.).</span></p>
          <p>Kidd provides us with a new theory on representation called &ldquo;REPRESENTATION AS &hellip; PERSUASION&rdquo; (Kidd, 2015, p. 32). One can see data art as an act of persuasion, and they often try to give voice to issues that need a platform, we can see that in my own website that has a bubble graph showing the lack of non-male streamers at the top (&ldquo;Data Art,&rdquo; n.d.). Another example is when data art is shown in advertisements when there is no easy way to fact check that the common person will pursue as well as there might be tiny disclosures on screen claiming the information is not true, but the average watcher is not paying attention(Cook, 2001; Kidd, 2015).</span></p>
          <p>The next theory given is about representation and identity politics, introducing the issues with representation. While something can look innocent and have no connotations attached, once there is politics involved, it is no longer an innocuous item. Thus, the conversation about true representation comes in, as important representation is, there are important questions to be asked under capitalism (Kidd, 2015).</span></p>
          <p>Data art uses scientific foundations to portray art. Artists use art and science as a way to represent their ideas and themselves or other. Data art allows for there to be a new and more efficient way of consuming data. Data used to be something that companies used to serve themselves however data art causes a reverse where data now serves us. Communicating and visually processing information have been important for many years, known as the visual paradigm. Representation is introduced and Kidd provides us with theories; </span>&ldquo;Representation and reality; representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation and identity politics&rdquo; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Kidd, 2015)</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representation can be difficult to define, however, representation can be seen as what is seen and what is understood, something from the constructivist approach from Stuart Hall. Connotation vs. denotation. An example given is the Apple logo, where one will see an apple drawn in a simplistic design and is white with a bite taken out of it and know that it is the company logo rather than the straightforward image. The visual examination has been something common but fairly new, it allows for a more open and loose analysis. Images have to be taken in with context and purpose because of situations such as photoshop and propaganda. Data visualisation is not solely aesthetic but also allows there for new knowledge generation, however, we do not know the repercussions of computational art. Roeser provides us with some of the uses of technologically driven art like data art, to provide representation and a platform for issues within society and voice marginalized groups. The issues that come with it are that of false advertising and unnecessary platforming of unrealistic scenarios. Something like 3D art is seen as unnecessary for data visualisation and it distorts and makes consuming the information difficult. Data art can also be seen as persuasive, using my own graph as an example, but also as mentioned earlier, false advertising. My Graph showed the discrepancy between male, female, and other identities within the streaming community. False advertising refers to the sly tricks that advertisers use to pursue buyers, even using lies. For example, when adverts use data to persuade people, but buyers have no actual way of confirming the data is true nor will the average viewer do so. Representation becomes even more complicated under politics and capitalism as innocuous items become politicked under capitalism and systemic discrimination.</span></p>
