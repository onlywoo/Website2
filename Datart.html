          <h1>Data</h1>
          <p>For the Data page, these show two basic bar graphs. The colours chosen are that of apex, the overarching theme throughout the website. There is interesting information to be withdrawn from these graphs if one is invested in ALGs but also confirm suspicions and worries about the actual game. The graphs are to highlight issues within the gameplay.</p>
          <p>For the interactive bar graph, the interaction is very simple as the user can select witch teams they wish to view and their points.</p>
          <h1>Data Art - streamgraph</h1>
          <p>The data art is the streamgraph where it displays the points progression of each team through 9 matches in descending order. When hovering over the stream, users can see which team they are looking at. This is a simple graph that shows progression over time, ideally there would have been a way to see the results more accurately where the number showed up when on hover, but this did not work out.</p>
          <h1>Exam Data Art &ndash; bubble graph</h1>
          <p>The bubble graph shows the discrepancy of representation within the gaming industry, the explanation of the importance can be found in my blogs section. Users can hover over the M,F, and Other as well as the circles to find the names of the streamers. The data art was chosen to show a very prominent issues within gaming that many have experienced. The reasoning for the &ldquo;other&rdquo; hover feature displays nothing is because I wanted the user to see that there is no well-known representation for non-cis gendered people and that many should seek out these marginalized identities.</p>
          <p>The data art took inspiration from this example</p>
