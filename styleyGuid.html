            <p>The reasoning for the colours stems from the Apex Legend
              s aesthetic all round. The red, black and white colours 
              are from the base game and the extra colours stem from the 
              season colours. Initially I had used a light lime-ish green
               for the decorative colour however I changed it to a dark
                blue because not only does it match the apex aesthetic 
                much more because of the lore and characters. Not only do
                 these colours make it easier on the users&rsquo; eyes it
                  also looks more appealing than the green.</p>

            aria-label="Reflect on Layout">
            <h1>Layout</h1>
            <p>The layout for the homepage is that way so users know 
              what the page is about and aren&rsquo;t overloaded with
               information immediately, each section takes up a page 
               purposefully as this is so users can get the information
              in each section the desire. The little information makes
              its easily digestible. For the blogs page, it was initial
              ly that the layout had all the blogs on one page but 
              decided to change this as it started to become difficult 
              to format because of how long the blogs are. This resulted
              in the names of the blogs displayed and their links are 
              next to the labels. Each blog page can be accessed from 
              the other. This makes reading the blogs easier as well as
              makes sure the user is never lost and knows where they 
              are at all times especially since the blog pages use a 
              sticky navigation. The data visualisation pages are 
              pretty typical of how one would think to lay it out. 
              The heading at the top so users know where they are, the
              other graphs are also placed at the top, so users 
              don&rsquo;t miss them. Information about the graph is 
              found underneath it in case users do want to learn 
              more about the graph outside of the heading.</p>

            <h1>Font</h1>
            <p>The font used is the one used within Apex, not only is It 
              clear and easy to read, it matches the overall aesthetic 
              perfectly.</p>
