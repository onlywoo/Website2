          <h1>Critical reflection &ndash; Data-Driven Artwork</h1>
          <p>Data-driven artwork refers to the aesthetic creation that comes from displaying data. This is where companies and things providing the data serve us rather than the other way around, converting data to a more easily consumable form that is relatable (Simpson, 2020). Communicating results and processes has been a part of communication for many years, being one of the oldest forms of communication. Drawings, visuals, and gestures are extremely effective in conveying information. Known as the demonstrational paradigm, it extends itself to &ldquo;&hellip;visual construction and visual data exploration&rdquo;. (Saket and Endert, 2019)</p>
          <p>Since we are able to choose anything for our data-driven art I will be displaying diversity in gaming, I chose this because it is important in general to see the disparity and how much gaming caters towards men, it&rsquo;s also important to this degree, to me and relates to my website which is about professional gaming (predominantly male competitors).</p>
          <div class="graph">
            <img
              src="Images/graph.png"
              width="90%"
              height="90%"
              alt="Apex Legends Logo"
            />
          </div>
          <p>The data art will display like this, this inspires it. The biggest circles will display the content creators and the bigger the circle the higher the pay/ viewer count.&nbsp; There will also be an option to display a certain demographic so that users can see the stark reality of the gaming sphere and who is the most popular and the lack of diversity. The colours will be different based on the gender identity of the creator to display the difference very clearly and users will be able to see the reality of the gender gap within gaming, however, the colours are in line with the website&rsquo;s aesthetic, which is red, greens, and brown. This type of data-driven artwork will display many diverse differences all at once.</p>
          <p>The reason that this type of data-driven artwork was chosen is that it has the ability to visually convey the very important lack of diversity, just like how this chart displays the biggest data breaches and hacks while highlighting important names. The different-sized circles emphasise the issues being shown by the entire chart, this will draw the user's eyes to the biggest creators. The Zoom-in feature to reveal information will allow users to get a more in-depth idea of the person and see if there is a pattern that emerges when reading about these creators or their identities or their earnings.</p>
          <p>As mentioned above, the data art will have interactivity that allows users to filter the desired demographic they would like to see on the chart. Interactivity for data visualisation is important. The definition of interactivity is that the user and data interact while the human (user) uses skills, abilities, expertise, and motivation. They initiate the interaction; the data is information derived from a source. The interaction between these two creates something known as the &ldquo;visualization system&rdquo;. (Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
          <p><em>&ldquo;A graphic is not &lsquo;drawn&rsquo; once and for all; it is &lsquo;constructed&rsquo; and reconstructed until it reveals all the relationships constituted by the interplay of the data. The best graphic operations are those carried out by the decision-maker himself.&rdquo;</em></p>
          <p>-(Bertin, 2011)</p>
          <p>Ultimately what I want to convey in this chart is for people to recognise a pattern within the data being provided and realise there is a huge issue with the lack of diversity. I would also like for users to realise how unsafe these online spaces are for non-men and look deeper into these issues. I hope the drastic sizes of the circles help emphasise these issues as well as encourage people to seek the lesser earning and known creators. The display, I would say, both subverts and enhances expectations, many people are aware of the diversity issues within gaming and online places, however, the chart might subvert expectations with how huge the gap actually is. This, in the end, is reliant on the person. Most women and non-men are aware of the problems while most men tend to not believe there is an issue or maybe not understand the severity of it.</p>
