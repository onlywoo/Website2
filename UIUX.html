            <h3>Analysis on my UI and UX</h3>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;UI supports UX, UI extends the UX, and, for sure, UI is the vehicle for UX. UI is the user connection to your application, which needs to be as simple and as clear as possible for your user. It must allow your user to do their work in a pleasing, easy, and efficient manner.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p><em>-</em>(Canziba, 2018)</p>
            <p>User Interface(UI) talks about the system that the user will be interacting with to relay their commands for the product. This is done through research techniques that allow the creators to understand how users&rsquo; brains work. UX refers to user experience and is an &ldquo;HCI-related concept&rdquo;(human-computer interface). (Joo, 2017)</p>
            <p>The interface is heavily reliant on design and interaction. This led to the 1 .&nbsp; &ldquo;Evolution of Minimal Design,&rdquo; which focuses on clear visual navigation and communication. The second is a 2. &ldquo;increase in Micro Interaction,&rdquo; this is to allow for the user to have as much control over their decisions. 3. Moving pictures have also become more popular to catch users&rsquo; attention and hold it. 4.&nbsp; It is important to be using rich colours and recognisable yet in theme typography as it pulls together the whole aesthetic and conveys the desired message from the product the last one is 5. &ldquo;Long scrolling and parallax technique websites&rdquo; refers to the infinite scrolling on a website as well as scrolling on mobile devices. (Joo, 2017)</p>
            <p>On my homepage, there is a navigation bar that changes the colour of the page when hovered over to show users they are in the correct place. On other pages, there is a homepage button that is a circle and when hovering it reveals the home page button. On the blogs page, there is something called sticky navigation where there are the headings of each blog post which leads to easy clear navigation of the page where the user cannot get lost.</p>
            <p>Within my own website, I will analyse how the decisions were made to adhere to these design elements and where there are improvements that need to be made, and what needs to be removed.</p>
            <p>On the homepage the biggest issue that can be seen is that the top bar navigation isn&rsquo;t clear at first, there is nothing separating the navigation from the rest of the page. Minimalism can be seen as the homepage is just basic on information and navigation. In order to introduce the micro-interactions, I plan on having a central home button(menu icon) that opens a menu of the possible other pages the user can go to and then subheadings of more specific places on the website users can go. This is something I wish to implement throughout the whole website as there isn&rsquo;t a consistent navigation system. The navigation changes and looks out of place, confusing the users. Another thing I wish to implement on the homepage is screen-wide images that show the possible information that is displayed on the website (for example, a section that explains the Apex Legends Esports scene and a button that leads to more information). This will be easier to navigate through the implementation of the sticky navigation bar on the home page.</p>
            <p>The page is Reminiscent of the EA Apex Legends website as that is what is about specifically and that is why the Apex Legends font is used. This is why the colour scheme of black and red however I am deciding on changing this as this isn&rsquo;t intuitive for users to be staring and bright reds or white on black, it makes the website difficult to look at. To fix this, I will be using the colours for the newest season (Season 14 is blues and greens). This will liven up the website and allow for a more creative aspect ( point number 4). One thing I want to bring to the forefront of developing my website is that it is more compatible with mobile users and can adapt to resolution changes. That was something I neglected on the previous website and want to work on it on this one.</p>
            <p>One thing that is personal to me that I have been exploring on my websites is the use of colours that are considered &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in male-dominated spaces. This is a perfect opportunity as e-sports and gaming, in general, are male-dominated. I want to combat the unprofessionalism that is associated with these colours and aesthetics as the idea of being feminine is seen as something to overcome and therefore less than rather than a concept that exists alongside masculinity.</p>
            <p>UI and UX is an important aspect of products that are being navigated by users, this is all products. In order to be able to create an intuitive and well-made product, you need to understand the aspects of UI/UX. All come together to create a coherent and well-made product. An amalgamation of these things makes a story and promote the experience the creator desire.</p>
