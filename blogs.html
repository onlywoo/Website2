            <h1>Overview of Data Visualization</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              <em
                >&ldquo;&lsquo;Data Visualization &rsquo; refers to the visual
                representation of statistical and other types of numeric and
                non-numeric data through the use of static or interactive
                pictures and graphics.&rdquo;</em
              ><em> </em>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>(Gatto, n.d.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Data visualization has been around for centuries, dating back to
              the 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD. Data visualization allows for human
              history to come to light. With the invention of computers, data
              visualization has come a long way in terms of aesthetics and has
              developed what is known as traditional data visualization, having
              different forms and characteristics. These allow for the
              understanding of data, efficiency and effectiveness to be
              emphasized. (Li, 2020)
            </p>
            <p>
              With the definition of Data visualization given, it shows that the
              visualization doesn&rsquo;t remove the narrative. The narrative
              and visuals are used in tandem to be able to further the data
              being presented. What is the main aim of visualization? According
              to Gatto, it is to &ldquo;elucidate patterns, gaps, schemes,
              regularities, and connections&hellip;&rdquo;, this is
              understandable as these are often overlooked and or difficult to
              make sense of when looking at raw data (data before it has been
              made visual). This allows for the knowledge gap to be reduced
              (Gatto, n.d.).
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a number of advantages that traditional data
              visualization has. Li describes four of them, the first one being
              that it has the ability to show data at a large scale instantly.
              Second, elucidates patterns or &ldquo;emergent properties&rdquo;
              within the data allowing the viewer to form an opinion. The third
              one is that problems can be identified immediately when it comes
              to product quality control. Lastly, that data visualization lets
              the viewer understand any scale of data (Li, 2020). While these
              advantages do make information easier to be evaluated they do come
              with challenges, human error and human restrictions, human eyes
              already have difficulty registering data and being able to extract
              useful information, another thing is that as the data pools get
              bigger there need to be bigger places to display them. One issue I
              find with data visualization when it comes to projects that
              require it is that the data is often dated and not current.
              Real-time scalability becomes important as it allows the viewer to
              formulate opinions based on how the data has changed and also
              shows a repeating pattern if one is present. (Agrawal et al.,
              2015)
            </p>
            <p>
              Aesthetics in data visualisation become important as it aids in
              bridging the knowledge gap. Aesthetic refers to beauty and has
              been proven to be important as it has the potential to make
              information easily understood. Aesthetics become important through
              colour, size, scale, positioning, typography, conveyance, and the
              way they are interacted with. (Cawthon and Moere, 2007). As
              mentioned above, human perception of traditional data makes it
              difficult to withdraw information (Li, 2020). Aesthetics has been
              proven to increase user ease of use of the entire system (Tuch et
              al., 2012). Aesthetic is personally important, specifically for
              people who have issues with concentrating and get easily
              overwhelmed by numerical information and walls of text, especially
              in children which only worsens in adulthood if not treated. The
              eye-catching appearance of data visuals and well-thought-out
              layout combats reading disorders that stem from ADHD. (De Silva et
              al., 2021)
            </p>
            <p>
              With this idea of data and putting it in a visual form to make
              more sense of it, we need to understand what data and information
              are. The idea of data varied depending on the context. In this
              case, data is referring to raw information recorded as the result
              of an action and therefore has meaning in that context. Come in
              the form of &ldquo;&hellip;names, numbers, age, signs, characters
              or symbols&hellip;&rdquo;(Li, 2020). When looking at information
              and data, especially as someone with the aforementioned
              conditions, these numerical values and words have no meaning and
              become increasingly more difficult to interpret when the data
              scale increases. According to Bellinger, Castro, and Mills, the
              recording of data has no meaning or use if unable to be understood
              by humans. (Bellinger et al., 2004)
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >&ldquo;Information is data that has been given meaning by way
                of relational connection. This &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; can be
                useful but does not have to be. In computer parlance, a
                relational database makes for information from the data stored
                within it&rdquo;</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>-(Li, 2020)</p>
            <p>
              As explained, data visualization is to present data in a way that
              is more easily understood, bridging the knowledge gap and becoming
              somewhat more accessible as we progress as humans. This means that
              data visualization comes in many forms. These different forms of
              data visualization all are able to represent data in the most
              conducive way. (Li, 2020)
            </p>
            <p>
              Since data visualization has exists to bridge knowledge gaps and
              make information easily digestible and elucidate patterns, there
              are characteristics of data visualization that need to be present.
              For example, it needs to be readable, like previously stated, if
              data can&rsquo;t be understood or interpreted by humans it is
              rendered useless. Second, is recognizability. This refers to users
              being able to identify knowledge from previously. Thirdly and
              last, the visual data should be easily understood (Li, 2020). This
              point has been reiterated throughout this analysis. This brings an
              interesting conversation about accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Talking about accessibility, the conversation about human
              perception and data visualization is created. It&rsquo;s
              incredibly important, another repeated point is that without data
              being perceived by humans it is useless. Users are being asked to
              formulate an opinion based on the visuals presented. As Ward et
              all. have exclaimed, perception is the way the world is
              interpreted by us. Developing a mental image of the environment.
              The human brain is known to &lsquo;fill in the gaps&rsquo; where
              there is ambiguity using known information (Ward et al., 2011).
              The perceptual process is a psychological study about this. How
              humans perceive and keep information. That due to the brain using
              previously learnt information to fill in ambiguity, there is a
              very quick yet low-level system in humans that can make sense of
              visuals. This was named &ldquo;preattentive&rdquo;
              (&ldquo;Perception in Visualization,&rdquo; n.d.).
            </p>
            <p>
              More with accessibility, there has been a repeated idea through
              the analysis of data visualization and it&rsquo;s that it to
              bridge the gap in knowledge. This then makes information more
              accessible. An article called &ldquo;Reaching Broader Audiences
              with Visualization&rdquo; (Lee et al., 2020) talks about this. For
              example, when there is about thirty-six million blind people, an
              obvious huge issue in terms of data visualization, people with
              IDDs (intellectual and developmental disabilities) are left out of
              the conversation. Previously it was said that data is being
              presented on computers, for someone who has physical disabilities
              might have difficulties accessing these. Knowledge is supposed to
              be for everyone, and the only way knowledge can expand, and grow
              is with the views of everyone from different backgrounds and
              perspectives. Credit is given where credit is due, data
              visualization does account for colour blindness as graphs and
              charts can be differentiated with patterns rather than colours.
              (Lee et al., 2020)
            </p>
            <p>
              Data visualization is incredibly important in making information
              easily accessible and digested by the viewer. It allows for
              patterns which would otherwise be hidden in walls of texts and
              numbers to emerge. Trends become easier to spot and therefore
              easier for decisions and opinions to be made. The data can be
              presented traditionally that is something that is seen very
              commonly but due to human perception, aesthetics come into play.
              Aesthetics helps cater for people who have difficulty
              concentrating and get easily overwhelmed by walls of text or
              numbers. Data comes in many forms and being placed in visuals
              makes them easier to understand. Data needs to be understood by
              humans because without the understanding or perception, the data
              becomes useless, It is essentially just a list of random things.
              Since data needs to be taken in by humans, there are huge groups
              of marginalized people being left out and have no way of accessing
              data, progress has been made as there is some catering towards
              colour blind people.<em><br /></em>

            <h3>Analysis on my UI and UX</h3>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;UI supports UX, UI extends the UX, and, for sure, UI is the vehicle for UX. UI is the user connection to your application, which needs to be as simple and as clear as possible for your user. It must allow your user to do their work in a pleasing, easy, and efficient manner.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p><em>-</em>(Canziba, 2018)</p>
            <p>User Interface(UI) talks about the system that the user will be interacting with to relay their commands for the product. This is done through research techniques that allow the creators to understand how users&rsquo; brains work. UX refers to user experience and is an &ldquo;HCI-related concept&rdquo;(human-computer interface). (Joo, 2017)</p>
            <p>The interface is heavily reliant on design and interaction. This led to the 1 .&nbsp; &ldquo;Evolution of Minimal Design,&rdquo; which focuses on clear visual navigation and communication. The second is a 2. &ldquo;increase in Micro Interaction,&rdquo; this is to allow for the user to have as much control over their decisions. 3. Moving pictures have also become more popular to catch users&rsquo; attention and hold it. 4.&nbsp; It is important to be using rich colours and recognisable yet in theme typography as it pulls together the whole aesthetic and conveys the desired message from the product the last one is 5. &ldquo;Long scrolling and parallax technique websites&rdquo; refers to the infinite scrolling on a website as well as scrolling on mobile devices. (Joo, 2017)</p>
            <p>On my homepage, there is a navigation bar that changes the colour of the page when hovered over to show users they are in the correct place. On other pages, there is a homepage button that is a circle and when hovering it reveals the home page button. On the blogs page, there is something called sticky navigation where there are the headings of each blog post which leads to easy clear navigation of the page where the user cannot get lost.</p>
            <p>Within my own website, I will analyse how the decisions were made to adhere to these design elements and where there are improvements that need to be made, and what needs to be removed.</p>
            <p>On the homepage the biggest issue that can be seen is that the top bar navigation isn&rsquo;t clear at first, there is nothing separating the navigation from the rest of the page. Minimalism can be seen as the homepage is just basic on information and navigation. In order to introduce the micro-interactions, I plan on having a central home button(menu icon) that opens a menu of the possible other pages the user can go to and then subheadings of more specific places on the website users can go. This is something I wish to implement throughout the whole website as there isn&rsquo;t a consistent navigation system. The navigation changes and looks out of place, confusing the users. Another thing I wish to implement on the homepage is screen-wide images that show the possible information that is displayed on the website (for example, a section that explains the Apex Legends Esports scene and a button that leads to more information). This will be easier to navigate through the implementation of the sticky navigation bar on the home page.</p>
            <p>The page is Reminiscent of the EA Apex Legends website as that is what is about specifically and that is why the Apex Legends font is used. This is why the colour scheme of black and red however I am deciding on changing this as this isn&rsquo;t intuitive for users to be staring and bright reds or white on black, it makes the website difficult to look at. To fix this, I will be using the colours for the newest season (Season 14 is blues and greens). This will liven up the website and allow for a more creative aspect ( point number 4). One thing I want to bring to the forefront of developing my website is that it is more compatible with mobile users and can adapt to resolution changes. That was something I neglected on the previous website and want to work on it on this one.</p>
            <p>One thing that is personal to me that I have been exploring on my websites is the use of colours that are considered &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in male-dominated spaces. This is a perfect opportunity as e-sports and gaming, in general, are male-dominated. I want to combat the unprofessionalism that is associated with these colours and aesthetics as the idea of being feminine is seen as something to overcome and therefore less than rather than a concept that exists alongside masculinity.</p>
            <p>UI and UX is an important aspect of products that are being navigated by users, this is all products. In order to be able to create an intuitive and well-made product, you need to understand the aspects of UI/UX. All come together to create a coherent and well-made product. An amalgamation of these things makes a story and promote the experience the creator desire.</p>
