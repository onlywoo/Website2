              <h1>Overview of Data Visualization</H1>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;&lsquo;Data Visualization &rsquo; refers to the visual representation of statistical and other types of numeric and non-numeric data through the use of static or interactive pictures and graphics.&rdquo;</em><em> </em></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>(Gatto, n.d.)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Data visualization has been around for centuries, dating back to the 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD. Data visualization allows for human history to come to light. With the invention of computers, data visualization has come a long way in terms of aesthetics and has developed what is known as traditional data visualization, having different forms and characteristics. These allow for the understanding of data, efficiency and effectiveness to be emphasized. (Li, 2020)</p>
              <p>With the definition of Data visualization given, it shows that the visualization doesn&rsquo;t remove the narrative. The narrative and visuals are used in tandem to be able to further the data being presented. What is the main aim of visualization? According to Gatto, it is to &ldquo;elucidate patterns, gaps, schemes, regularities, and connections&hellip;&rdquo;, this is understandable as these are often overlooked and or difficult to make sense of when looking at raw data (data before it has been made visual). This allows for the knowledge gap to be reduced (Gatto, n.d.).</p>
              <p>There is a number of advantages that traditional data visualization has. Li describes four of them, the first one being that it has the ability to show data at a large scale instantly. Second, elucidates patterns or &ldquo;emergent properties&rdquo; within the data allowing the viewer to form an opinion. The third one is that problems can be identified immediately when it comes to product quality control. Lastly, that data visualization lets the viewer understand any scale of data (Li, 2020). While these advantages do make information easier to be evaluated they do come with challenges, human error and human restrictions, human eyes already have difficulty registering data and being able to extract useful information, another thing is that as the data pools get bigger there need to be bigger places to display them. One issue I find with data visualization when it comes to projects that require it is that the data is often dated and not current. Real-time scalability becomes important as it allows the viewer to formulate opinions based on how the data has changed and also shows a repeating pattern if one is present. (Agrawal et al., 2015)</p>
              <p>Aesthetics in data visualisation become important as it aids in bridging the knowledge gap. Aesthetic refers to beauty and has been proven to be important as it has the potential to make information easily understood. Aesthetics become important through colour, size, scale, positioning, typography, conveyance, and the way they are interacted with. (Cawthon and Moere, 2007). As mentioned above, human perception of traditional data makes it difficult to withdraw information (Li, 2020). Aesthetics has been proven to increase user ease of use of the entire system (Tuch et al., 2012). Aesthetic is personally important, specifically for people who have issues with concentrating and get easily overwhelmed by numerical information and walls of text, especially in children which only worsens in adulthood if not treated. The eye-catching appearance of data visuals and well-thought-out layout combats reading disorders that stem from ADHD. (De Silva et al., 2021)</p>
              <p>With this idea of data and putting it in a visual form to make more sense of it, we need to understand what data and information are. The idea of data varied depending on the context. In this case, data is referring to raw information recorded as the result of an action and therefore has meaning in that context. Come in the form of &ldquo;&hellip;names, numbers, age, signs, characters or symbols&hellip;&rdquo;(Li, 2020). When looking at information and data, especially as someone with the aforementioned conditions, these numerical values and words have no meaning and become increasingly more difficult to interpret when the data scale increases. According to Bellinger, Castro, and Mills, the recording of data has no meaning or use if unable to be understood by humans. (Bellinger et al., 2004)</p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Information is data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection. This &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; can be useful but does not have to be. In computer parlance, a relational database makes for information from the data stored within it&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p>-(Li, 2020)</p>
              <p>As explained, data visualization is to present data in a way that is more easily understood, bridging the knowledge gap and becoming somewhat more accessible as we progress as humans. This means that data visualization comes in many forms. These different forms of data visualization all are able to represent data in the most conducive way. (Li, 2020)</p>
              <p>Since data visualization has exists to bridge knowledge gaps and make information easily digestible and elucidate patterns, there are characteristics of data visualization that need to be present. For example, it needs to be readable, like previously stated, if data can&rsquo;t be understood or interpreted by humans it is rendered useless. Second, is recognizability. This refers to users being able to identify knowledge from previously. Thirdly and last, the visual data should be easily understood (Li, 2020). This point has been reiterated throughout this analysis. This brings an interesting conversation about accessibility.</p>
              <p>Talking about accessibility, the conversation about human perception and data visualization is created. It&rsquo;s incredibly important, another repeated point is that without data being perceived by humans it is useless. Users are being asked to formulate an opinion based on the visuals presented. As Ward et all. have exclaimed, perception is the way the world is interpreted by us. Developing a mental image of the environment. The human brain is known to &lsquo;fill in the gaps&rsquo; where there is ambiguity using known information (Ward et al., 2011). The perceptual process is a psychological study about this. How humans perceive and keep information. That due to the brain using previously learnt information to fill in ambiguity, there is a very quick yet low-level system in humans that can make sense of visuals. This was named &ldquo;preattentive&rdquo; (&ldquo;Perception in Visualization,&rdquo; n.d.).</p>
              <p>More with accessibility, there has been a repeated idea through the analysis of data visualization and it&rsquo;s that it to bridge the gap in knowledge. This then makes information more accessible. An article called &ldquo;Reaching Broader Audiences with Visualization&rdquo; (Lee et al., 2020) talks about this. For example, when there is about thirty-six million blind people, an obvious huge issue in terms of data visualization, people with IDDs (intellectual and developmental disabilities) are left out of the conversation. Previously it was said that data is being presented on computers, for someone who has physical disabilities might have difficulties accessing these. Knowledge is supposed to be for everyone, and the only way knowledge can expand, and grow is with the views of everyone from different backgrounds and perspectives. Credit is given where credit is due, data visualization does account for colour blindness as graphs and charts can be differentiated with patterns rather than colours. (Lee et al., 2020)</p>
              <p>Data visualization is incredibly important in making information easily accessible and digested by the viewer. It allows for patterns which would otherwise be hidden in walls of texts and numbers to emerge. Trends become easier to spot and therefore easier for decisions and opinions to be made. The data can be presented traditionally that is something that is seen very commonly but due to human perception, aesthetics come into play. Aesthetics helps cater for people who have difficulty concentrating and get easily overwhelmed by walls of text or numbers. Data comes in many forms and being placed in visuals makes them easier to understand. Data needs to be understood by humans because without the understanding or perception, the data becomes useless, It is essentially just a list of random things. Since data needs to be taken in by humans, there are huge groups of marginalized people being left out and have no way of accessing data, progress has been made as there is some catering towards colour blind people.<em><br /></em></p>

            <h3>Analysis on my UI and UX  </h3>
            <p><strong>UI and UX Design</strong></p>
          <p>UI and UX design are incredibly important in making anything but especially websites as you need the website to not only be easy to use but also creative/fit the desired aesthetics. UI refers to &lsquo;user face design&rsquo; and has to do with the relationship between visual design and interaction design. UX is what makes the interface useful and helps users complete their desired action and is usually universally applicable when making products. (Goldberg, 2022)</p>
          <p><strong>What is good UIUX?</strong></p>
          <ol>
              <li>Firstly, there is something known as &lsquo;information architecture.&rsquo; This important aspect allows for easy navigation of the product regardless of the device being used, this allows for the most efficient navigation. This is the major thing my website is missing and am actively trying to fix it.</li>
              <li>Interaction design refers to the aesthetic; the colours used, fonts, images, graphics, icons, audio, etc.</li>
              <li>Wireframing is used to make sure you have an efficient website, the planning lets you not only use creativity but also be productive. They make sure that the websites have the basic necessary things to make a functioning website.</li>
              <li>Visual design is incredibly important as it's what decides where the users look as well as if they can even<span>&nbsp;</span><em>look</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the page. Aesthetics also lets you convey the feeling you want, for example, artistic, creative, innovative, formal, business, etc.</li>
              <li>If usability is higher then the chance of success for your product increases, the easier it is to use the more customers/users will be eager to use and recommend your product.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>-(Kumar, 2019)</p>
          <p>Throughout my website, I kept UI and UX design in mind and tried to make the user's experience easier. The way that I did this was by using responsive navigation (expanded when on hover to know that they are clicking the correct one), jump to the top of page buttons in the writing section to avoid having to scroll to the top again. Corresponding colours across pages to make sure navigation buttons were obvious. As for navigation, the UI and UX are good and concise. To ensure full ease of use, there is text directing users around the page if needed. The writing is in white to fully capture the user&rsquo;s eye; the navigation is a brighter colour as opposed to the rest of the pages to highlight them.</p>
          <p>The use of consistency makes the website easier to use and users can navigate and make decisions quickly while also allowing frequent users to not even have to read to understand the UI and UX.</p>
          <p>While I am content with my UI and UX there is room for improvement, for example, on the art page, the images are spread around and become confusing, there are also no captions, and the images are bigger than some and make the page look messy. Navigation becomes convoluted as there isn&rsquo;t much on the page vs the other pages and the amount of navigation there is. Another problem I have with the UI is that the pages do not adjust correctly as the resolution changes, I have ideas on how to fix it so the problem should not persist.</p>
