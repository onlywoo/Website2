<h3>Close Reading - Interaction for Visualisation for data</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Data visualization has seen a recent trend to extend the demonstrational paradigm to visualization construction and visual data exploration. This raises interesting challenges, such as: what are the core components needed for tools implementing the demonstrational interaction paradigm? How are visualization tools implementing the demonstration interaction paradigm different from existing tools? And more fundamentally, what user tasks are well-suited for demonstration?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>-</em>(Saket and Endert, 2019)</p>
<p>Communicating results and processes have been a part of communication for many years, being one of the oldest forms of communication. Drawings, visuals, and gestures are extremely effective in conveying information. Known as the demonstrational paradigm, it extends itself to &ldquo;&hellip;visual construction and visual data exploration&rdquo;. (Saket and Endert, 2019)</p>
<p>Defining interaction for visualisation has been an ongoing challenge for HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). The way that Dimara and Perin sought out the definition was by gathering papers and applying the recursive process. The results ended up being that the main two components are <em>user </em>and <em>data.</em> The user refers to a human being who has skills, abilities, expertise and motivation. These are the ones who begin the interaction.&nbsp; Data refers to information about an object derived from a source. Between this interaction is a mediator known as the <em>visualization system. </em>&nbsp;(Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
<p>The interaction is divided into two, internal and external.</p>
<p>Internal Entities:</p>
<p>In order to be considered an interaction there has to be a goal, &ldquo;data-oriented intent&rdquo;, or a problem. Exploring data at a high level is what intent is referring to. Intent can go further and include the intent to collect and correct data or present data.(Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
<p>External Actions:</p>
<p>Interaction can also be seen as a dialogue between the user and the visualization system. Action and reaction. The user performs an action, and the visualization system provides a&nbsp; reaction. The reaction is referred to as &ldquo;&hellip; <em>permutation of graphical marks, change of transformation parameter, and alteration of the pipeline&rdquo;. </em>(Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
<p>Internal actions:</p>
<p>The internal actions come from the cognitive reaction of the user to the visualization, this refers to the analytical process of the user.(Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>

<p>Now that we have a definition for interaction for visualization, what exactly does this consist of? It is once again split into external and internal actions.(Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
<p>External Entities:</p>
<p>Interaction pertains to physical things such as your mouse, pen, keyboard, and physical constraints. It also refers to bodily movements, speech, head and eye movement (Dimara and Perin, 2020). One thing that is often ignored is modalities, restrictive modalities can lead to a &ldquo;disjointed picture of human performance&rdquo;.(Liu and Stasko, 2010)</p>
<p>Internal Entities:</p>
<p>There are cognitive processes such as users' previous knowledge, &ldquo;internal mental representation&rdquo;(Sedig and Parsons, 2013), &nbsp;and skills and abilities when interacting with a visualization system.</p>
<p>External actions:</p>
<p>There are many actions that are within an interaction that can influence the data, changing the way it is represented. There is a conversation between users and the external environment. (Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
<p>There are benefits and critiques of interaction. Interaction is used to &ldquo;amplify cognition&rdquo; in data exploration where the users are able to have command over the space of information. Interaction crosses the border for audiences and allows for accessibility when data is presented visually (Dimara and Perin, 2020). What are the critiques though? Interaction is rarely the forerunner of research. The main issue is how there is no thought given to human and technological modalities such as speech, sound, pen, and touchscreen. This restriction is the result of technical issues, money and no foundation that connects external representation and internal cognitive processes. This is often a big issue within technology, this is a reason why accessibility is seen as a last thought and marginalized groups of people are left out of the conversation(Dimara and Perin, 2020)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A graphic is not &lsquo;drawn&rsquo; once and for all; it is &lsquo;constructed&rsquo; and reconstructed until it reveals all the relationships constituted by the interplay of the data. The best graphic operations are those carried out by the decision-maker himself.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>-(Bertin, 2011)</p>
<p>This gives us two ideas on interaction. The first is that it is necessary for providing information on complex data. The second is that interaction allows users to have control over their data exploration. (Tominski, 2015)</p>
<p>Interaction for data visualization has been difficult to define however through research, Dimara and Perin were able to find a definition that pertains to two keywords, <em>users</em> and <em>data. </em>Data visualization has been a part of communication for millennia as information has to be portrayed to others. Throughout the paper, the definition of interaction is focused upon. It has been divided into internal and external concepts. User refers to the human user and data refers to the information formed from a source. Internal concepts generally refer to the cognitive processes a user goes through whereas external usually have to do with&hellip; external sources, technological items like the desktop or pen. Interaction and visualization are seen as a dialogue between human users and visualization systems where both have a common central interest.</p>
